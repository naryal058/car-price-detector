Car Price Detector: 
The Car Price Detector is a model that predicts the price of a car based on its name, company name, date of manufacture, kilometers run, and type of fuel use. The model was built using Quikr data from Kaggle and employs linear regression, onehotencoder, and pipeline methods to make predictions.

Dataset: 
The Quikr car data was collected from the Indian classifieds website Quikr. The dataset contains over 893 cars and includes information on car name, company name, date of manufacture, kilometers run, type of fuel use, and price. The data was preprocessed and cleaned before building the model.

Model: 
The Car Price Detector model uses linear regression to predict the price of a car. Onehotencoder is used to transform categorical features into numerical features, and the pipeline method is used to combine the preprocessing steps and the regression model. The model was trained and tested on the Quikr dataset, and the effectiveness of the model was calculated using the r2 score.

Usage:
To use the Car Price Detector, simply input the car name, company name, date of manufacture, kilometers run, and type of fuel use into the model, and it will predict the price of the car.

Conclusion:
The Car Price Detector is an effective model for predicting the price of a car based on its features. By using the Quikr dataset, linear regression, onehotencoder, and pipeline methods, the model was able to accurately predict car prices. This model can be useful for car buyers and sellers who want to estimate the value of a car.
